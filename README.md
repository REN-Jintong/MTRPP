Multiple traveling repariman problem with profits.

We propose an effective hybrid search algorithm under the framework of memetic algorithm.

Here is the benchmark instances and the source code of the proposed algorithm.

The benchmark instances are grouped into 2 groups collected from [1][2]: Ins_Avci (230 instances) and Ins_Lu (240 instances).

The source code is implemented in C++ and compiled with g++ 7.5.0. It will be made available upon the publication of the manuscript.
The manuscript is in submitting.
